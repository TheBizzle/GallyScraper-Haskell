## GallyScraper-Haskell

Here lies a tool for scraping some data about what [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo) models are and aren't compiling from a [Galapagos](http://www.github.com/NetLogo/Galapagos) server.  It's a Haskell reimplementation of [this](http://www.github.com/TheBizzle/GallyScraper).
